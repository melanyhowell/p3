## UX and UI

Creating products that are useful, useable and provide value using UCD (User Centered Design)

Organisation Goals + User Goals + User Interface + Interaction with Back End System = User Experience

User Centric Design process using 5 planes of UX is what I will focus on to ensure a positive expeirience for the user

---

## Strategy Plane

The Idea, Objectives and Users needs

### Initial Idea

To create a Application that allows people to access many different styles and sources of recipies from many different collaborators, while also advertising high quality kitchen tools and appliances.

### User Stories and Goals

Being the primary user I expect the following -

+ Being able to share my recipies with a larger community.
+ also be able to expand my knowledge from other users submissions.

As the owner I want the following from my site -

+ To create a repository of recipies from the data submitted by many different people.
+ I can add my own recipies to one location and make sure i can refer back to them later.
+ See if recipies submitted can be improved by users suggestions.
+ Promote with the hope to increase sales of a brand of cooking implements and tools.
+ Increase visitors and contributions to the site

As a developer I am looking to provide the following -

+ Clean, efficient and easily intuitive design
+ No bugs or errors throught the site with features responsind correctly to vistors requests
+ User Centered Design process followed to ensure user has a postive expereince whenever they use my application

---

## Scope Plane

How am I going to provide users with what they want

Which features, based on information from strategy plane, do you want to include in your design?

+ The Creation of a web application that stores and allows access to users recipes, while also allowing for editing of the recipie by the recipie creator and suggestions by other users.
+ Fields within the recipes to make them easily understandable and comparable to other recipies on site include, ingredients, preperation time, cook time, tools, cooking steps.
+ Create the backend code and frontend form(s) to allow users to add new recipes to the site, edit them and delete them.
+ Create a search function using the backend and frontend functionality for users to locate recipes based on selected recipe's fields such as ingredients.
+ Easy to read and intuitive design to allow easy navigation of an ever increasing recipe directory
+ With-in the tools section include relevant detail and links to promote sales of the my kitchen tools.
+ Look into incorporating a scoring system for recipies that users can rate and review tried recipies

---

## Structure Plane

Interaction of features

How is the information structured and how is it logically grouped, the features, the elements, the data, the information?

+ Recipes can be searched by using the keyword or title from the recipe such as from the ingredients list and also other keywords included when creating the recipe such as vegetarian, pasta etc.
+ Home Page - introduction to the site
  + Links to the tools used in the recpies
+ Recipes Page

## Skeleton Plane

Inteface and Navigation Design

### How will our information be represented, and how will the user navigate to the infomration and the features?

Navigation throughout the site will be from the Nav Bar accesible in the header of every page. The Header and Footer will stay consistent on every page to aid navigation.

#### Header

+ Navbar -

![Header](/assets/readmeimages/header.png)

#### Footer

+ Social Media & Contact Links for Owners and Developer

![Footer](/assets/readmeimages/footer.png)

### How do you navigate through the information and features?

From within the recipie page you can either click on one of the categories represented or search for a specific recipe

### How will the content relate to each other, what relationships will the content have?

### What has priority and lower priority and based on this where do we position the content?

I focused on a simple priority progression to allow for easy manuverability throughout the site, where you can go from Home, to the main recipe repository to a single recipe.

Priority was also given to help visulaise how a recipe might be followed in reality, for exaple you'll need to know what need preheating and prepared first and the stages that follow that to ensure the recipe is followed correctly and the users desired result is acheived at the end of it.

## Testing

Due to the large amount of testing required i had to colate the reults and processes on a seperate page please [click here](testing.md)

## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages.

+ Go To your Git Hub Repository
+ Under Repository Name, click on "Settings"
![setting image](/assets/readme-images/Repository%20Settings.png)
+ Click on "Pages" options on the left hand side of the screen
![Page selection](/assets/readme-images/pagessettings.png)
