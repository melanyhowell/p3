## Credits & Acknowlegements

+ Inspiration for Email confirmation popup comes from youtube link - (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AF6vGYIyV8M) - [Easy Tutorials]
+ I looked up on youtube for some tutorial help with javascript and the memory games and used the following for reference - (https://github.com/code-sketch/memory-game/)
+ https://www.youtube.com/@CodingArtist was a great help especially when getting stuck on time value issues and helping bug proof the game so only two cards can be picked at a time and an already matched card can't be turned back over if clicked again.
