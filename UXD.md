## Inteface and Navigation Design (Skeleton Plane)

### How will our information be represented, and how will the user navigate to the infomration and the features?

Navigation throughout the site will be from the Nav Bar accesible in the header of every page.

#### Header

+ Logo -
+ Navbar -

![Header](/assets/readmeimages/header.png)

### How do you navigate through the information and features?

From within the recipie page you can either click on one of the categories represented or search for a specific recipe

### How will the content relate to each other, what relationships will the content have?

### What has priority and lower priority and based on this where do we position the content?

I focused on a simple priority progression to allow for easy manuverability throughout the site, where you can go from Home, to the main recipe repository to a single recipe.

Priority was also given to help visulaise how a recipe might be followed in reality, for exaple you'll need to know what need preheating and prepared first and the stages that follow that to ensure the recipe is followed correctly and the users desired result is acheived at the end of it.
